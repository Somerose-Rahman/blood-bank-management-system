*****Blood Bank Management System****
Description:
 This is a project build for educational purpose. As my varsity wants a project I have made it done. 
This project is about the patients who need bloods in critical section and finding blood is much difficult when you need the blood. So that this software is being created. Here you can add donor and also add his donated time. Because of there is some limitation to donate blood. Like that you can’t donate blood if you have donated it within 3 months. And your age and weight is also very important here. 
In the other hand, there you can search the donor with the blood group. If you find the donor, you can take blood.  Thus you can save a life
That’s my software. 

Table of contents:
Here is some contents in the software:
1.	Add Doner
2.	Search Doner

The print section of the slip is not created here. It will save as a PDF file in the chosen directory, after that it can be printed.
